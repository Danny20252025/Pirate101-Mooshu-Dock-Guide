    <div class="main-column1">
      <h2 class="section-header">Dock connections</h2>
      <p>These areas are simply connected. In Subata Skyway, you can find this dock, which connects to The Paths of Penance, which connects to the Temple of the West Wind.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Zeke Quest Info!</h2>
      <p>There are actually two zeke collectibles if you are doing his quest for this dock and the locations it is connected to. One is in The Paths of Penance and the other is in the Temple of the West Wind.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">The Paths of Penance Knife</h2>

        <img src="../images/thepathsofpenanceknifeshow.png" alt="The Paths of Penance Knife Show">
      </div>
      <p>The knife is in the central square area on the left edge when entering from the Icy Dock.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Temple of the West Wind Knife</h2>
      <div class="dock-layout1">
        <img src="../images/templeofthewestwindknife.png" alt="Temple of the West Wind Knife">
        <img src="../images/templeofthewestwindknifeshow.png" alt="Temple of the West Wind Knife Show">
      </div>
      <p>The knife is on the opposite side of the entrance to The Paths of Penance.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Lo Pan Drops</h2>
      <p>The following drops come from Lo Pan in the Temple of the West Wind. His droprates are very friendly, so if you are lucky, you may get the items first try or within 30 minutes to an hour. There are some things to keep note of for this fight. Minions will spawn periodically throughout the fight, however their health is extremely low at about 5 health or so. The goal is to defeat Lo Pan. Lo Pan will disappear once defeated for a few rounds and return stronger than before. While he is gone, his minions will still be on the board. If you are using old scratch and mojo, it is important to conserve your mojo flows in this battle.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Lo Pan's Helm</h2>
      <div class="image-pair">
        <img src="../images/lopan'shelm.png" alt="Lo Pan's Helm">
        <img src="../images/assassin'sgloom.png" alt="Assassin's Gloom">
        <img src="../images/lopan'shelmstats.png" alt="Lo Pan's Helm Stats">
      </div>
      <p>Lo Pan's Helm provides 6 magic resist and 53 maximum health. It also provides a power, Assassin's Gloom, which is a melee power that does 0.75x your mojo at the end of each round for 5 rounds to everyone that was adjacent to you when you used it. It can be helpful on swashbucklers and mojo classes like Privateer, Witchdoctor, and sometimes Musketeer due to its mojo scaling. Swashbucklers can use it well by hiding, using the poison, and waiting for it to proc many times while staying invisible to avoid damage. I think it's mainly just a cool stitch though ðŸ˜Š.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Lo Pan's Cloak</h2>
      <div class="image-pair">
        <img src="../images/lopan'scloakmale.png" alt="Lo Pan's Cloak Male">

        <img src="../images/lopan'scloakstats.png" alt="Lo Pan's Cloak Stats">
      </div>
      <p>Lo Pan's Cloak provides 33 magic resist and 65 maximum health. It also provides a power, Mojo Storm, which does a superior blast of magic damage in a 3 by 3 block. It has 3 range but this can be increased depending on your weapon's range. It does require line of sight to use. The base damage on this power is very high, and with mojo buffs from scratch, it is very potent. This makes this robe a good option for Privateer, Witchdoctor, and sometimes Musketeer, because they tend to use mojo well.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header2">Tower of Moo Manchu</h2>
      <div class="dock-layout1">
        <img src="../images/towerofmoomanchuprettier1.jpg" alt="Tower of Moo Manchu Prettier">
        <img src="../images/towerofmoomanchulocation.png" alt="Tower of Moo Manchu Location">
      </div>
      <p>Finally, we get to the Tower of Moo Manchu. If you haven't done the side quests to unlock Moo Manchu yet, visit the Subata Temple Docks page <a href="subatatempledocks.html">here.</a> The Tower of Moo Manchu is a very long dungeon with 10 fights, one on each floor of the tower. There is a huge amount of notable drops that come from this dungeon, so I will be splitting this into subsections. I recommend you find a group to do this with, as it can be very difficult to solo. I recommend "cabining" this dungeon. What this means is, on the tenth floor, we are able to farm the final boss, Moo Manchu, over and over without having to restart the dungeon. Each time you defeat Moo Manchu, open the crowns shop and preview the ship cabin. Wait in there for five minutes before leaving the cabin by exiting the cabin door. Repeat the process. This is an exploit. However, there is little to no history of anyone being banned for using this. Considering the droprate of some items like the tide boots, which can approach a 1/300 chance, it is extremely unlikely you will ever acquire certain items without using the exploit. However, use it at your own peril.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Competitive Items</h2>
      <div class="image-pair1">

        <img src="../images/imperialbootsofmoomanchu.jpg" alt="Imperial Boots of Moo Manchu">
      </div>
      <p>The totems, charms, and rings on display here are all viable alternatives at max level for the best gear. They provide powerful powers. The dragon axe of doom is a weapon that can serve as an alternative at max level with its provided epic, turn the tide, which can get you to turn the tide 5 (very powerful) if your pet doesn't get double turn the tide, for example. The boots used to be the best boots in the game for any ranged classes including Privateer, since its power prevents ALL enemies from moving for one turn. However, with new enemies that have buffs they only use when stuck in place, it can make things worse. It is now a situational item that excels when it does work. As mentioned above, the droprate for the boots is EXTREMELY low.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Class-Specific Items</h2>
      <p>These items can drop from many floors of the tower. They are good gear to use if you don't have the best gear yet or are not max level.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header1">The Nefarious Five</h2>
      <img src="../images/nefariousfive1.png" alt="The Nefarious Five" class="rounded-img">
      <p>The Nefarious Five are on the 8th floor of the Tower of Moo Manchu. Each of the five is a boss and will have some unique gear and powers as a result. There is a lot of nice looking gear that can drop as loot from these guys and be used as stitches, so I will have images of the gear to show how it looks. Another thing to note is that if you use the object in the middle of the arena, you will turn to the enemy's side. You will get a badge that, when equipped, will make your eyes glow red ðŸ˜ˆ. If you do get the badge though, from now on, you will always be charmed to Moo Manchu's side when in an adjacent square to him while fighting him.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Ignoble Johnathan Ashburn Drops</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/nefariousknives.jpg" alt="Nefarious Knives">
        <img src="../images/nefariousknivesshow.jpg" alt="Nefarious Knives Show">
        <img src="../images/death'sbargain.jpg" alt="Death's Bargain">
        <img src="../images/death'sbargainshow.jpg" alt="Death's Bargain Show">
      </div>
      <p>The knives come with a good power and ok epic but due to it getting its bonuses from agility, swashbucklers mainly benefit, but they already have many hiding abilities. The death's bargain is more interesting, because it will drain from a random enemy or ally next to you when you get below 50% health. The drain is based off of your mojo. This can be good on Privateer sometimes to increase your survivability, but it is usually reserved for PVP.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Faithless Josef Hawkins Drops</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/dragonaxeofdoom.jpg" alt="Dragon Axe of Doom">
        <img src="../images/dragonaxeofdoomshow.jpg" alt="Dragon Axe of Doom Show">

      <h2 class="section-header">Insensitive Faye Jennings Drops</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/turncoat'scap.jpg" alt="Turncoat's Cap">
        <img src="../images/turncoat'suniform.jpg" alt="Turncoat's Uniform">
        <img src="../images/turncoat'sboots.jpg" alt="Turncoat's Boots">
        <img src="../images/turncoatset.jpg" alt="Turncoat Set">

        <img src="../images/masqueofthelotus.jpg" alt="Masque of the Lotus">
        <img src="../images/masqueofthelotusshow.jpg" alt="Masque of the Lotus Show">
      </div>
      <p>Most of the gear from Insensitive Faye Jennings could serve well for a stitch, but it's largely unremarkable. The Masque of the Lotus has a fun ability where it has a chance to charm enemies that approach you, but the chance is quite low.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Unreliable Benjamin Wright Drops</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/nefariousnovablaster.jpg" alt="Nefarious Nova Blaster">
        <img src="../images/nefariousnovablastershow.jpg" alt="Nefarious Nova Blaster Show">
      </div>
      <p>The Nefarious Nova Blaster looks really cool and would be great for a stitch. The ability on it could be good in niche situations, but the tradeoff is too high for it to be the meta.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Disloyal Lynne Finkle</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/nefariousstaff.jpg" alt="Nefarious Staff">
        <img src="../images/nefariousstaffshow.jpg" alt="Nefarious Staff Show">
        <img src="../images/baronsamedi'smasque.jpg" alt="Baron Samedi's Masque">
        <img src="../images/baronsamedi'smasqueshow.jpg" alt="Baron Samedi's Masque Show">
      </div>
      <p>The wand is not bad. The summons can be useful. The low range on this weapon makes it hard to use sometimes though. The masque is interesting and can be an alternative if you choose. The soul harvest allows you to have a chance to summon an undead spirit minion in a random square if you kill an enemy. The minion is not super strong but it is still one of the stronger eyepatches out there.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header1">Moo Manchu's Drops</h2>
      <img src="../images/moomanchub.png" alt="Moo Manchu" class="rounded-img">
      <p>Finally, you've reached the top floor ðŸ˜©. Let's see what Moo Manchu can drop.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Moo Manchu's Hat, Robe, and Boots</h2>
      <div class="image-pair">
        <img src="../images/imperialhatofmoomanchu.jpg" alt="Imperial Hat of Moo Manchu">
        <img src="../images/imperialrobesofmoomanchu.jpg" alt="Imperial Robes of Moo Manchu">
        <img src="../images/imperialbootsofmoomanchu.jpg" alt="Imperial Boots of Moo Manchu">
      </div>
      <p>We already talked about the boots. The hat gives an interesting power, but the damage is low and the smoke blocks your team's line of sight, not just your enemy's, making it bad more often than not. The robes give a good power that summons 9 minions in a 3 by 3 box. It may be good in hard fights as long as you don't mind battles taking much longer waiting for each minion to take its turn.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Moo Manchu's Staves</h2>
      <div class="image-pair2">
        <img src="../images/staffofpowerswashbuckler.jpg" alt="Staff of Power - Swashbuckler">
        <img src="../images/staffofpowerprivateer.jpg" alt="Staff of Power - Privateer">
        <img src="../images/staffofpowerwitchdoctor.jpg" alt="Staff of Power - Witchdoctor">
        <img src="../images/staffofpowerbuccaneer.png" alt="Staff of Power - Buccaneer">
        <img src="../images/staffofpowermusketeer.png" alt="Staff of Power - Musketeer">
      </div>
      <p>These staves provide interesting powers that grant epics, but to be honest, none of them are particularly that great. The swashbuckler one could be niche in the future because it prevents the enemy team from healing. Besides the powers, there is nothing really noteworthy about them.</p>
