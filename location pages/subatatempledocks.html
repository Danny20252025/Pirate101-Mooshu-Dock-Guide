      <p>These areas are simply connected. The Subata Temple Docks are in Subata Skyway. It is connected to the Subata Temple, which has the Subata Teahouse inside.</p>

      <img src="../images/towerofmoomanchusubata.jpg" alt="Tower of Moo Manchu Subata" class="dock-image rounded-img">
      <p>The Tower of Moo Manchu is a long dungeon that provides very good loot for all classes of pirates. Although most pieces have been largely outdated at max level, many pieces have high droprates and may be worth getting at level 65 to hold you until max level.To unlock the Tower of Moo Manchu, you need to pick up and do two sidequests, both from Lord Chagatai in the Subata Teahouse. You can start the first one while you are questing in Mooshu and stop by Subata Temple. It's called "The Moo Manchurian Candidate". Once you've completed that, wait until you're level 65. Then, return to Lord Chagatai and pick up another side quest called "The Shadow of Moo Manchu". This side quest will have you confront Moo Manchu in his tower and unlock it permanently for farming purposes. The Tower of Moo Manchu is located in the Paths of Penance at the Icy Dock. An in-depth look at the tower will be explained there.</p>
      <h2 class="section-header">Shiriku Neko: Musketeers and Swashbucklers Rejoice!</h2>

      <p>Shiriku Neko is a great companion to have for both Musketeers and Swashbucklers. She comes with a decent amount of good epics that make her a solid second choice for your team in case your main companions are wounded. She is also invaluable if you need melee units on musketeer for a certain fight that may or may not be Rooke. I recommend giving her first strike 3, blade storm 2, and a riposte for epics. For talents, try going 4 points each into tough, rough, accurate, and dodgy with one point in agile. You can get her by doing a side quest called "The Silk One" which comes from Constable Shao in Subata Temple.</p>
